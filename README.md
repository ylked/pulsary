## Description

Pulsarly is a time-tracking API. It enables students, professionals, freelancers and others to determine the time spent on their work. The application lets you start and stop a stopwatch or manually enter a working time. Projects can be created to classify completed tasks.

For professionals, it's also possible to enter an hourly rate and determine the price a project has cost, so as to more simply invoice customers.

Project-based statistics can be generated over several days, weeks, months, etc., with various values. An export function provides data in CSV or PDF format.
